# full front & back -end project - e-store

## full functioning e-store

This project is to make a platform to sell products online.
There is a separation in the abilities and the action that types of users can make.

## The website is mobile-friendly and intuitive so the basic user won't need any explanation.

### ( but if help needed there are instructions on how to log in and use the site )

### type of users

- seller
- user
- un-subscribe user

| type of user  | unique action capabilities                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| seller        | **add products** - only seller can add product! |
| seller & user | add products to shopping list                   |
| seller & user | look at there user's info                       |

## action capabilities for all users

- can browse and look at the products â€‹
- log in & sing in
- - the website **does not** save the passwords as is, it encrypts them and saves the hash only.
